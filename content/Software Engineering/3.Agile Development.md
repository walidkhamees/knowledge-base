Agile is a software development approach that prioritizes rapid development and delivery of software products.

This approach focuses on quickly delivering functionality and responding to changes.

Agile methods were created in the 1990s to address the issues with plan-driven development.  
The agile approach concentrates on the software itself rather than the documentation.  
It develops software in a series of increments, and aims to reduce bureaucracy as much as possible.

### The Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto outlines key values that prioritize certain aspects of software development over others.


* **Individuals and interactions** are valued over processes and tools.
* **Working software** is valued over comprehensive documentation.
* **Customer collaboration** is valued over contract negotiation.
* **Responding to change** is valued over following a plan.

While the items on the right have value, the items on the left are valued more.

### Incremental Development

All agile methods are based on incremental development and delivery. This approach focuses on software features, with the most important features being implemented first.

* The process begins by prioritizing the features of the software.
* The details of a feature are defined only for the increment being implemented.
* After a feature is implemented and delivered, users can try it and provide feedback.
* The team then moves on to define and implement the next feature.

### Key Agile Principles

**Involve the customer**: Customers should be closely involved with the development team to provide and prioritize new requirements and evaluate each system increment.

**Embrace change**: The team should expect product features and their details to change as they learn more about the product. The software should be adapted to cope with these changes.

**Develop and deliver incrementally**: Software products should always be developed in increments, with each increment tested, evaluated, and used to provide feedback to the development team.

**Maintain simplicity**: Focus on simplicity in both the software and the development process, eliminating complexity wherever possible.

**Focus on people, not things**: The development team should be trusted to work in their own ways without being limited by prescriptive processes.

### Scrum

Scrum is an agile method that provides a framework for agile project organization and planning without mandating specific technical practices.  
It's based on developing software in short, fixed-length periods called **sprints** (one month or less).

#### Key Scrum Roles and Concepts

* **Product Owner**: A team member responsible for identifying product features and attributes. They review work and assist with testing.
* **Development team**: A small, self-organizing team (typically 8 people or less) responsible for developing the product.
* **ScrumMaster**: A team coach who guides the team on the effective use of Scrum.  
They are not a conventional project manager but may have some project management responsibilities.
* **Product backlog**: A to-do list of items such as features, bugs, and improvements that need to be completed.  
The list should be prioritized so the most important items are at the top.

* **Sprint**: A fixed-length period (one month or less) during which a product increment is developed.

* **Potentially shippable product increment**: The output of a sprint, which should be of high enough quality to be deployed for customer use.

* **Daily scrum**: A short daily meeting where team members review progress, discuss problems, and plan for the day.

Sprints are "timeboxed," meaning development stops at the end of the sprint, regardless of whether the work is completed.  
Unfinished items are returned to the product backlog for a future sprint.
