All set of software development has 4 steps.

-  **Specification**
    - Defining what the system is supposed to do.
-  **Design And Implementation**
    - Defines the architecture of the system. and implementing the system.
-  **Validation**
    - Testing the system to make sure it works as expected.
-  **Evolution**
    - Making changes to the system over time. based on customer feedback.

There are two types of processes for software development

1. **Plan-driven development**
    - As the name suggests, It's a process where the plans is developed in advance and process is measured against the plan.
    - [[2.Waterfall Development]] falls under this category.
    - Great for projects with a clear plan and a well-defined scope. (e.g. financial Projects where requirements are unlikely to change much)
2. **Incremental development**
    - Here planning  is incremental and it's easy to change the process based on the feedback.
    - [[3.Agile Development]] and [[4.Extreme Programming]] fall under this category.

*It's important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for software development.*
*It depends on the project, the team, the company, and the industry.*
