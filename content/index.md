title: How can you contribute?
---

- **By**: [[Waleed Khamees]]


This is a knowledge base for the RemoteCoders bootcamp cohort 9.

You can contribute by adding your notes, resources, or any other relevant information that can help your fellow bootcampers.

I started this knowledge base to help us all share our learning experiences and resources.

This knowledge base is built using obsidian markdown.

here is a brief introduction to obsidian markdown syntax:

- **Headings**: Use `#` for headings. For example, `# Heading 1`, `## Heading 2`, etc.
- **Bold**: Use `**text**` for bold text.
- **Italic**: Use `*text*` for italic text.
- **Links**: Use `[text](url)` for links.
- **Images**: Use `![alt text](image_url)` for images or `![[image_name]]` for images in the knowledge base.
- **Lists**: Use `-` for bullet points or `1.` for numbered lists.
- **Code**: Use backticks `` `code` `` for inline code or triple backticks for code blocks.
- **Blockquotes**: Use `>` for blockquotes.
- **Horizontal Rule**: Use `---` for a horizontal rule.
- **Links to other notes**: Use `[[note name]]` to link to other notes in the knowledge base.

If you want to create a new note, copy the template below and paste it into a new markdown file in the `content` directory.
Also, please create a new file in the `content/People` directory with your name as the filename so people can get to know you better.

Your note content goes here. You can use the markdown syntax to format your note.
You can also link to other notes using the `[[note name]]` syntax.
You can also add images, links, and other resources to your note.
